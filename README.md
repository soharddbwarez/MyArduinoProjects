# MyArduinoProjects
This is an actual copy of the Arduino IDE Projects that I made and have running actively or have run it before on one of my Arduino UNO, Nano boards or one of the newer ESP8266 and ESP32 boards that I own. 
I've tested my code on either the:
```
1. Geekcreit® Arduino UNO R3 ATmega328P Development Board
2. UNO+WiFi R3 ATmega328P+ESP8266 Module
3. Arduino Geekcreit® ATmega328P Nano V3 Controller Board Improved Version
4. Geekcreit® D1 Mini V2.3.0
5. TTGO T-Display ESP32, CH9102F (16MB), WiFi & Bluetooth Module,
   1.14 Inch LCD which is the Development Board LILYGO for Arduino
```
These are all clones that I got from BangGood China but they all seem to work fine and they are dirt cheap so if you have any of these boards that I mentioned above and you have all the Arduino Libraries installed that I have then you should be able to get my code running with no issues.

I even have the Arduino Libraries included because I don't only have the default libraries installed but many, many more so this way you can take a look at my libraries directory if you want to compare or you just copy whatever you need to get your project working.

I do updates regularly for everything so it shouldn't really matter if you copy the Arduino libraries from me or you install the libraries from within the Arduino IDE which I highly recommend you doing instead of copying it from me but I know you can't get all of the libraries from Arduino originally which is why I have my libraries directory included for you here.

I'm new to using GitHub and Git which I started using very recently so keep that in mind because I expect that I'm going to make mistakes since I learn from actually doing things first and then I'll clean up the mistakes I've made so if you're using the code that I'm sharing you're going along with me, however I'm open to collaborate with other developers here on GitHub because I know I can't do it all on my own and I like to see what other developers can do to help making my projects better and add functionality, things that didn't even cross my mind which is a good thing to my opinion.

## TODO
```
1. Adding more projects
2. Figuring out how to use Git and GitHub correctly (I started working with Git recently)
3. I also need to learn all the nuances of the Arduino IDE 2.0
4. One of those nuances is the Autoformatting feature (.clang-format file at the root of a sketch) 
   that I may want to use in the future.
   Important links for detailed info about the clang-format:
   i.   Clang-Format Style Options - Clang 16.0.0git documentation https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html
   ii.  Example file of .clang-format https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/tooling-project-assets/main/other/clang-format-configuration/.clang-format
   iii. ClangFormat configuration file for official Arduino code style https://github.com/arduino/tooling-project-assets/tree/main/other/clang-format-configuration
5. Collaborate with other developers
6. Keep opimizing and updating my code projects
