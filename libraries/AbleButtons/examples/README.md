# Examples

Example project files showing some usage of the Arduino Button Library Extension.

The following examples are provided:

* Buttonable provides an AbleButtons equivalent to the built-in Button Arduino example.
* Buttonable2 uses button debouncing to ensure a steady button signal.
* ButtonableAll shows using ButtonList to check all buttons are pressed before lighting the inbuilt LED.
* ButtonableCallback shows how callback functions can be used to signal a button is pressed or released.
* Debouncable provide an AbleButtons equivalent to the built-in Debounce Arduino example.
* DebouncableAny shows how pressing any button in a list can light the built-in LED.
* DebouncableCallback shows how the on-released callback can be used to capture a button-click.
* Doublable provide shows how double-clicking a button.
* Holdable shows how the on-held check can be used to delay an activity.
* HoldableCallback shows how the on-held and on-idle events can create a timed LED timer.
* TestAbleButton asserts AbleButton values to ensure AbleButton works as expected.
