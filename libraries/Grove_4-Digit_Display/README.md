[Grove - 4-Digit Display](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-4-Digit-Display-p-1198.html)

4 digit display module is usually a 12 pin module. In this Grove gadget, we utilize a TM1637 to scale down the controlling pins into 2 Grove pins. It only takes 2 digital pins of Arduino or Seeeduino to control the content, even the luminance of this display. For projects that require of alpha-numeric display, this can be a nice choice.

***Library Requirement***

Install libraries on Arduino Library Mnager.
