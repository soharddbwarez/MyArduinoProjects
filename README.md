# MyArduinoProjects
This is an actual copy of the Arduino IDE Projects that I made and have running actively or have run it before on one of my Arduino UNO, Nano boards or one of the newer ESP8266 and ESP32 boards that I own. 
I've tested my code on either the:
```
1. Geekcreit® Arduino UNO R3 ATmega328P Development Board
2. UNO+WiFi R3 ATmega328P+ESP8266 Module
3. Arduino Geekcreit® ATmega328P Nano V3 Controller Board Improved Version
4. Geekcreit® D1 Mini V2.3.0 or on the TTGO T-Display ESP32, CH9102F (16MB), WiFi & Bluetooth Module,
   1.14 Inch LCD which is the Development Board LILYGO for Arduino
```
These are all clones that I got from BangGood China but they all seem to work fine and they are dirt cheap so if you have any of these boards that I mentioned above and you have all the Arduino Libraries installed that I have then you should be able to get my code running with no issues.

I even have the Arduino Libraries included because I don't only have the default libraries installed but many, many more so this way you can take a look at my libraries directory if you want to compare or you just copy whatever you need to get your project working.

I do updates regularly for everything so it shouldn't really matter if you copy the Arduino libraries from me or you install the libraries from within the Arduino IDE which I highly recommend you doing instead of copying it from me but I know you can't get all of the libraries from Arduino originally which is why I have my libraries directory included for you here.
