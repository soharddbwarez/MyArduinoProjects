# MyArduinoProjects
This is an actual copy of the Arduino IDE Projects that I made and have running actively or have run it before on one of my Arduino UNO, Nano boards or one of the newer ESP32 boards that I own. Most of the code is tested and works but some of it will be experimental which will be the projects that I'm actively working on.
