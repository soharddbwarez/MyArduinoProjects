OneBitDisplay README
--------------------
To use OneBitDisplay with C code, first build the static link library by
typing 'make' on the command line. The ArmbianIO library must be installed
and built before building this library. It manages Linux I/O interfaces.

To use OneBitDisplay with C++ code, use the epd_cpp_demo as a guide. The 
library code will be included in your project code at compile time.
