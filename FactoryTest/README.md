# FactoryTest sketch for the TTGO T-Display ESP32
# WiFi + Bluetooth and 1.14 Inch LCD
# Type: ch9102f 16MB 
# Development Board LILYGO 

Because the factory test sketch is pretty handy
showing the functionality of the board on the 
display, you can use the two buttons on the board
the button on the left will invert the colors
and the button on the right has two functions
click it fast to show you a second screen
with the voltage measurement and when you hold
the right button for a second you'll trigger
the deep sleep funtion which is nice for battery
saving.

So you have basic functionality of the board
that can be used as an example so you have
something that clearly works and that you
can use as a reference, or starting point.

The original code was broken and isn't being
managed anymore as far as I can tell.

That's why I made a copy of the code and
made the necessary changes to get it working
again.

So feel free to use this code to get your
TTGO T-Display Board as you got it from the
factory.
